1. Automated tests for the Recipe project development pipeline would fit within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed so that the code can be tested whenver a change gets pushed. Manually running some them locally before pushing does help, but you wouldn't need to run all of them especially for parts of the code you didn't change. Running them all only after development is completed means we are not testing the code while it is being developed, making it hard to tell if the finished product is even completed.

2. No, since this form of testing is used to automate and test user actions.

3. No, since you would most likely use end to end testing for this since this requires the testing of multiple components and how they interact with each other.

4. Yes since this can easily be checked by giving an input of a string and checking if it is allowed or not allowed by the feature.
